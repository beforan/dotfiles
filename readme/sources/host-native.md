# Stuff I install natively

Note that this is VERY host dependent.

- Some hosts may cme with stuff pre-installed e.g.
  - Bazzite -> preinstalls Steam, Ptyxis, Brew etc.
  - macOS -> preinstalls git
- On all hosts it *could* be a direct download (installer or `/opt`), otherwise:
- macOS -> App Store
- Atomic Fedora -> `rpm-ostree`
- Fedora -> `dnf` / Discover
- Ubuntu -> `apt` / snaps

etc.

# Apps

- VS Code (if not Flatpak, then native)

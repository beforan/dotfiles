## Stuff I install via brew (instead of nix)

Typically only command line tools, and even then only ones that Nix is weird about.

Realistically this should be very few things since brew is sloooow, and nix is declarative and has an extensive package ecosystem.

At least brew is fairly sensible about userspace, so works well with Immutable/Atomic distros, hence its default inclusion with Universal Blue distros.

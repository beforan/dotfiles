## Stuff I install via Flatpak (instead of nix)

In many cases, GUI apps via Flatpak is a preference if they're not core things.

Or if they are but aren't nicely done via nixpkgs/home-manager (e.g. nixGL stuff).

Examples:
- Edge (or browsers generally)
- Godot

Some core things are arguably preferred via Flatpak if not provided by other means:
- Ptyxis - if not provided by the distro, Flatpak is the preferred distribution for this

# System tools

- Terminal emulators
  - Ptyxis - if not provided by the distro, use Flatpak
  - iTerm2 - install via Nix configuration
  - ...?

# Command Line Tools

# GUI Apps

- VS Code (if not Flatpak, then native)
- Web Browsers
  - Edge
    - Linux: Flatpak
    - macOS: Native

# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

Some of them aren't proper dotfiles but are otherwise settings files I want to keep centrally.

Rather than scripts to put things in place and symlink, my prevailing approach now is to use Nix to do as much as possible declaratively.

For now the focus is standalone Nix on linux.

In time, macOS stuff will be here too, and perhaps NixOS eventually.

More docs to follow as stuff takes shape.

## Old dotfiles

My previous setup which *did* use scripts to put stuff in place across windows, linux and macos, to different extents, is still available on the `legacy` branch.
